## Summary

### Modeling Forward Rates for Bond ETF Pricing

This Project aims to explore and model forward rates from the US Treasury curve using a classic stochastic model, to ultimately price an investment-grade bond ETF (LQD).

### Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis Using Monte Carlo Simulation

The goal of this project is to construct an optimized portfolio using a combination of T-Bills, Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA), and then evaluate the risk profile of the portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. We will assess the difference in Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation under normal and fat-tailed return distributions to highlight the importance of accounting for extreme events in financial modeling.
